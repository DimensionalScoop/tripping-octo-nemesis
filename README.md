##Plot
**SD055871 - A distant sector of the galaxy**


You are in your stateroom as commander-in-chief Kil'Kina enters. "Rebellion forces are attacking the main cluster. Distress signals were delayed and jammed; were the only space station in range to send relief. You must depart at once." Knowing that you are outgunned and outnumbered you set out for the cluster, hoping to turn the tide in an almost lost battle...


##Gameplay
You are the captain of an heavy spacecraft carrier alongside another carrier controlled by a second player. As you advance further into space you encounter rebellion forces, asteroids and merchants. Most times you will be fighting enemy forces by directing up to 16 spacecrafts - called flyer- while managing the carrier's resources: Should you deploy all flyer at once, risking to sacrifice some in the process, or switching damaged flyers and freshly repaired ones, staking your carrier's hull - it's your choice.
